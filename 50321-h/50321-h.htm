<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>Early in this century, the old Bureau of Biological Survey
put out a booklet called &ldquo;Fifty Common Birds of Farm
and Orchard,&rdquo; with paintings by Louis Agassiz Fuertes.</p>
<p>In 1962, a former Fish and Wildlife Service staffer named
Rachael Carson wrote &ldquo;Silent Spring,&rdquo; a book that changed
American thinking about birds&mdash;and pesticides.</p>
<p>That first volume is out of date because of our great
population shifts in six decades. And I hope that &ldquo;Silent
Spring&rdquo; will be out of date some day; that our birds will
live with us in an unpoisoned environment of cities and
towns that are cleaner, healthier, greener.</p>
<p>So here is a new &ldquo;bird book&rdquo; from the Department of the
Interior, geared to the 50 birds you might see in <i>your</i> city,
with paintings done by a man who picked up the fallen
Fuertes brush, Bob Hines. These are not endangered birds,
except as all living things are endangered; some of them
are living in or passing through your backyard or city park
right now. Look well at Bob&rsquo;s art; he is not commemorating
the passenger pigeon but trying to open your eyes to the
world about you.</p>
<p>And he is trying to suggest that these birds can live in
our towns and cities so long as you help provide the healthy
habitat they need, habitat that is healthy not just for them
but for you.</p>
<p>Enjoy this little book, learn from it, and take a vow that
our springs will <i>not</i> be silent of bird calls&mdash;and will be
more silent of human clatter.</p>

<p>Look for this bird in groves and shade trees in residential
areas of towns and suburbs. Smaller than a robin, the male&rsquo;s fiery
orange and black is easy to spot. As he wings by, his bright colors
add a flick of glory to the urban scene.</p>
<p>The song is a rich series of whistled notes. Wintering to South
America, the oriole&rsquo;s summer breeding range stretches from
Nova Scotia to north Texas. This is the architect of the graceful
pendulent nests usually seen only after the leaves have fallen,
and the birds have gone.</p>

<p>Length about 7 inches; distinguished among our swallows by
deeply forked tail. While they breed throughout the United
States, they winter to South America.</p>
<p>This is one of the most familiar farm birds and a great insect
destroyer, seeking prey from daylight to dark on tireless wings.
Its favorite nesting site was barn rafters, upon which it stuck
mud baskets to hold its eggs. But modern barns are fewer and so
tightly constructed that swallows can not gain entrance, and in
much of this country they have turned to boat docks, commercial
buildings, summer homes, and the out buildings of rural
suburbs to keep the species going. Like other rural birds, they
have to adjust to changing land-use patterns.</p>

<p>Length about 5 inches. Resident in most of North America.</p>
<p>Because of its delightful notes, its flitting ways, and its fearlessness,
the chickadee is one of our best known birds. It responds
to human encouragement, and by hanging a constant supply of
suet this black-capped visitor can be made a regular feeder in
suburban gardens or city yards. Though small in size, these
cousins of the titmice are highly useful against insects, gleaned
mostly from the twigs and branches of trees. The chickadee&rsquo;s
food is made up of insects and seeds, largely seeds of pines, with
a few of the poison ivy, some weeds, and sunflowers.</p>

</div>
<p>About 6 inches long, bluebirds breed in the United States,
southern Canada, Mexico, and Guatemala, wintering in the southern
half of the Eastern United States and south to Guatemala.</p>
<p>The bluebird was once a familiar tenant of towns, hailed as the
herald of a new vernal season, and decidedly domestic in its
habits. About the time that starlings became so very numerous,
it declined in numbers. No one is sure why its numbers fell but
competition for nest sites by starlings and house sparrows is certainly
partly responsible. Recently it has begun to reappear in
many places.</p>
<p>Its favorite nesting sites are natural cavities in old trees, boxes
made for its use or crannies in buildings. Nesting boxes may be
restoring the species, whose occupants pay rent by destroying
insects. The bluebird&rsquo;s diet consists of 68 percent insects and 32
percent vegetable matter. The commonest items of insect food are
grasshoppers first and beetles next, while caterpillars stand third.
Small flocks sometime invade yards for the red fruits of flowering
dogwood trees.</p>

<p>You either admire or hate this arrogant, foot-long hustler,
easily identified by its brilliant colors. The blue jay is resident
in the eastern United States and southern Canada, west into the
Dakotas, Colorado, and Texas.</p>
<p>Like most insolent creatures, this jay has a dual nature. Cautious
and silent in the vicinity of its nest, it is bold and noisy
away from it. Sly in the commission of mischief, it is ever ready
to scream &ldquo;thief&rdquo; at anything poaching on its domain. As usual
in such cases, its epithet is applicable to none more than itself,
as neighboring nest holders know to their sorrow; for during the
breeding season the jay lays heavy toll upon the eggs and young
of other birds. But with all its sins of pride and lust, back yards
are enlivened by the presence of blue jays.</p>

<p>This quail, about 10 inches long, is known by the clear call that
suggests its name. It is native in the United States east of the
Rockies and has been introduced many places in the West.</p>
<p>The bobwhite, and its call, is loved by every countryside visitor.
It is one of the most popular game birds and appreciated as a
gourmet&rsquo;s delight. Quail have moved into our suburbs, although
its numbers have diminished in many States through loss of habitat.
About half the food of bobwhites consists of weed seeds, a
tenth of wild fruits, and a fourth grain. Most of the grain it consumes
is picked up from stubble. Fifteen percent of the bobwhite&rsquo;s
food is composed of insects, including several of the most serious
pests, but its greatest value is aesthetic.</p>

<p>Length 5 inches. Breeds from Alaska and Canada south to the
Great Lakes States and Connecticut; also in the mountains south
to Nicaragua; winters over most of its range.</p>
<p>Rarely indeed is the creeper seen at rest. It appears to spend
its life in an incessant scramble over the trunks and branches of
trees, gleaning its insect food. It is so protectively colored as to
be practically invisible to its enemies and though delicately built
possesses strong feet and claws. Its tiny eyes are sharp enough
to detect insects so small that most other species pass them by.
The creeper fills a unique place in the ranks of our insect destroyers:
minute insects, their eggs and larvae, moths, caterpillars,
small wasps, scales and plant lice are items of its diet.</p>
<p>It does not appear in flocks. Single birds or pairs will feed
infrequently on beef suet at bird stations, but it&rsquo;s seldom a regular
visitor.</p>

<p>About 11 inches. Breeds from the Gulf to southern Canada and
west to Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana; winters in the southern
half of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>The brown thrasher is more retiring than either the mockingbird
or catbird, but like them is a splendid singer. Not frequently,
indeed, its song is taken for that of its more famed
cousin, the mockingbird. It is partial to thickets and gets much
of its food from the ground. Its search for this is usually accompanied
by much scratching and scattering of leaves; whence its
common name. Its call note is a sharp sound like the smacking
of lips, useful in identifying this long-tailed, thicket-haunting
bird, which does not relish close scrutiny. The brown thrasher is
not so fond of wild fruit as the catbird and mocker, but devours
a much larger percentage of animal food.</p>

<p>This most familiar and most common of the wild geese is best
known in urban areas as a visitor in spring and fall.</p>
<p>Sizes vary, but the head and neck markings make this goose
easily identifiable. The Canadas breed on lake shores and coastal
marshes, primarily in Canada, and migrate in organized units
utilizing the well known V-formation, although sometimes flying
in long strings of birds. Flying by day and night, Canadas have
set down in flocks on city squares, apparently mistaking a pool of
light for a water surface. They seldom live in cities or towns, although
visiting urban parks on occasions. Their honking cries in
migration have stirred the blood of many an urbanite on a fall
night when traffic noises let the wild cry from the skies leak
through.</p>

<p>Color alone would make cardinals favored birds. Their striking
plumage is easily seen and long remembered. Though mild
mannered, they will sometimes chase each other from a feeding
station in early winter, but by late winter and spring they
eat side by side.</p>
<p>Preferring vines, shrubbery, and thickets, they will live comfortably
in city yards and parks. Since cardinals do not migrate,
they will remain in one yard the year round, as long as food is
available. Often nesting in bushes beside busy sidewalks, or near
enough to homes that their every move can be watched, they often
have several broods a year.</p>
<p>Their usual song is a clear and ringing whistle. While no two
birds seem identical in sound, their songs are distinctive, and
once learned, will always bring pleasure.</p>
<p>These fine birds are now found in most states, and range north
as far as southern Canada.</p>

<p>In some localities the catbird is fairly common. Tangled growths
are its favorite nesting places and retreats, and ornamental shrubbery
around houses will attract and keep them inside a town. The
bird has a fine song, frequently broken by mewing like a cat. Its
habits are somewhat similar to those of its cousin, the mockingbird,
with song almost as varied, but it is more secretive and usually
sings while hidden in the bushes. It feeds on fruit and insects,
and can be lured to shelves and windows by raisins, cherries, or
chopped apples.</p>

<p>Found in open or bushy woodlands or along the margins of agricultural

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to figure out how these birds ever existed without urban
areas, since they literally earn their first name by nesting and
roosting in chimneys, propping themselves against the inside surface
with short, spiny tails.</p>
<p>This swift is normally found only east of the great plains. Small
birds at about 5 inches long, they are aloft all day long, and almost
always in groups. They migrate in large flocks and nest from
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Watching a flock of swifts
flow funnel-like into a chimney is a startling evening experience.
The birds express themselves with a chatter of chipping cries,
one of the easiest identifications of the species. Their only food is
insects, and they are highly beneficial.</p>

<p>This slim bird is only about 5 inches long. You can spot it by a
chestnut brown crown, black line through the eye, and a black bill.
Chippies nest throughout the United States; they even breed as
far south as Nicaragua and as far north as southern Canada, and
winter in the southern United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>Chipping sparrows are domestic birds that show little fear of
humans. They often build nests in gardens, cemeteries or golf
courses, where mowed lawns provide feeding areas. Among the
most insectivorous of all sparrows, their diet consists mainly of
insects, supplemented by weed seeds.</p>

<p>Cowbirds are the only native American birds to always lay their
eggs in nests of other species, and have the young raised by foster
parents. Warblers, finches, and sparrows, all smaller than cowbirds,
are the chief victims of this practice, the fast growing foster chick
monopolizing food and space to the detriment of the legitimate
offspring.</p>
<p>This is the smallest blackbird, flocking in small groups, or mixing
with grackles and red-wings. They are usually quiet, their only
song a faint whistle. They range north into Canada and winter in
the southeastern States. Grasshoppers, beetles, and a number of
insects are eaten, and like other blackbirds, they do some damage
to grain.</p>

<p>Smart enough to adapt quickly to urban life, crows nest in such
unlikely places as alongside the Pentagon, and feed in the White
House grounds in Washington.</p>
<p>Typically, they feed in the early hours before many people are
out, retreating to parks or fields when disturbed. Their nest-robbing,
crop destroying habits are often exaggerated, and less
attention paid to their diet of grubs, beetles, mice, and other pests.</p>
<p>Grackles, martins, flycatchers, and other smaller birds, recognizing
them as marauders, will chase crows in the spring and summer.
Watching the little feathered dive-bombers attack the lumbering

a sparrow at all, but a weaver finch.</p>
<p>Almost universally condemned after its introduction into the
United States, the house sparrow not only held its own, but increased
in numbers and extended its range. It now occupies its
own niche and is regarded with amusement and considerable affection
in our inner cities.</p>
<p>In rural areas it does some damage to fruit, vegetables, and
grain. On the other hand, it also eats a number of insects that
damage those same crops.</p>

<p>Less than 5 inches long, this tiny bird seems to live right at
home with a man-made house. It breeds throughout the United
States, except for the South Atlantic and Gulf areas, and also nests
in southern Canada. It winters in the southern United States and
Mexico.</p>
<p>The rich, bubbling song of the familiar little house wren is one
of the sweetest associations connected with town or suburban
life. Its tiny body allows it to creep into all sorts of nooks and crannies
for its insect food. A cavity in a fence post or porch roof, a
wren box, a hole in a tree, will be welcomed as a nesting site.
Their food is grasshoppers, beetles, bugs, spiders, cutworms, ticks,
and plant lice.</p>
<p>Recognized universally as Johnny and Jenny wren, welcome
neighbors, they still show peculiarities in their behavior. Jealous
of their home areas, wrens sometimes puncture the eggs of other
small species nesting nearby, and Johnny may have two, possibly
three mates at one time.</p>

<p>These birds are commonplace in appearance and not very large

oft-repeated cries of &ldquo;kildee.&rdquo; They breed throughout the United

<p>The killdeer is probably the best known of the shorebirds, perhaps
because of its contrasting colors and startling cry. It is noisy
and restless, like people, but most of its activities are beneficial to
man. Its food is harmful insects, particularly weevils and beetles,
flies, ticks, and wondrously enough, mosquitoes and their larvae.</p>
<p>The four pointed eggs are marked like pebbles, and laid in an
unlined depression on the ground. Such dangerous sites as gravel
roads, quarries, or even potato patches have been used.</p>

<p>One of the largest ducks, mallards range across the entire
northern hemisphere, and are probably the best known of all
waterfowl, likely to set down in migration on small pools in city
parks. It has also been widely domesticated or semidomesticated.</p>
<p>Its coloration makes identification easy, and the loud quack
helps identify it. The birds breed in prairie waterholes in Canada,
the Dakotas, Minnesota, and, to a minor extent, in other northern
States. They move with the great spring and fall migrations and,
adjusting easily to the presence of man, are likely to be seen in
town or city. Add the domesticated mallards that swim about in
so many parks and you have the most urbanized of the ducks that
can still claim a wild heritage. They are most abundant in the
Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p>Ten inches long and neatly but soberly feathered, this was the
bird of the Old South, but it is resident now from southern Mexico
north to Michigan, Maine, even up to Wyoming, and seems to be
spreading farther.</p>
<p>Because of its incomparable medleys and ability to mimic other
birds, whistles, clocks, and bells, the mockingbird is the most
renowned singer of the Western Hemisphere. Even in confinement
it is a masterly performer, and in the nineteenth century,
many were trapped and sold for cage birds. This practice ceased
long ago, under law and close scrutiny. Mockers will feed on cultivated
fruits, but they have so won human affection that this is
rarely charged against them&mdash;principally because of that reputation
as a songster and the fact that they eat a variety of destructive
insects.</p>
<p>Raisins, oranges, or apples will bring them to a feeding station.
To prevent them driving all other birds away from your tray, it

<p>Mourning doves eat the seeds of plants, including grain, plus
berries and the small wild fruits of any region through which
they pass. Despite that melancholy but peaceful &ldquo;coo,&rdquo; they are
restless migratory creatures. Doves live in the large cities, small

<p>Myrtle warblers are tiny mites that liven up the trees and
shrubs in the spring migration. Traveling in small flocks, they
seem to be constantly in motion, flitting from branch to branch
searching for small insects and their eggs. Like flycatchers, they
snap up larger bugs on the wing. To a quiet observer, they seem
trusting birds, often singing at close range.</p>
<p>Some winter as far north as the New England coast, wherever
bayberry thickets offer fruit and shelter, and others move on to
the southern states. From these wintering grounds they migrate
to nesting grounds in the evergreen forest of the northern states
and Canada. In their fall flight south, they seem subdued, the
bright yellow on the crown and flanks having disappeared, and
the lemon colored rump the only remaining brilliant.</p>

slender wings of nighthawks exaggerate their size. They are 10
inches long, but seem bigger.</p>
<p>At rest, they perch lengthwise on branches, crossarms, or logs,
or on the ground. In the air, their flight is a series of fluttering
spurts, followed by long glides. Before aviators broke the sound
barrier, nighthawks had their own &lsquo;sonic boom,&rsquo; created by diving
vertically from considerable height and flaring sharply upward
near the ground.</p>
<p>Flying insects, from mosquitoes to beetles and moths, are their

<p>This is the largest (8 inches long) of the swallow tribe. It
formerly built its nest in cavities of trees and still does in wild
districts, but having learned to live close to humans, it soon
adopted domestic habits. The best way to have martins around is
to erect apartment houses for them at suitable nesting sites&mdash;and
protect that housing from use by other birds. The nest boxes
should be about 15 feet from the ground and made inaccessible to
cats. A colony of martins makes great inroads upon the insect

comprise less than 10 percent of its diet.</p>

<h2 class="bird" id="c47">WOOD PEWEE
<br /><span class="small">(Contopus sp.)</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="photo47">
<img src="images/img025c.jpg" alt="" width="582" height="417" />
</div>
<p>The bird of this painting ranges from the east coast through
the Mississippi Valley, where its range meets that of the western
wood pewee. They are hard to tell apart visually, although the
songs are quite different. Both species also look like eastern phoebes,
so spotting this bird with assurance requires some study. The
names of all these birds are based upon their calls, and all are
flycatchers.</p>
<p>The pewees like groves of mixed trees, and at twilight the eastern
species sings a plaintive whistled song that is longer and more
varied than its daylight song. You are much more likely to see or
hear these birds in outer suburbia housing areas than in the inner
city or on shopping center parking lots, since they require tall
trees and cannot be heard above traffic noises.</p>

<h2 class="bird" id="c48">WOOD THRUSH
<br /><span class="small">(Hylocichla mustelina)</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="photo48">
<img src="images/img026a.jpg" alt="" width="586" height="369" />
</div>
<p>This bird is at least fairly common in suburban groves all over
the eastern United States. Adults are a bit over 7 inches long and
their song is like a flute phrase followed by a soft trill, heard
usually at dawn or dusk.</p>
<p>There are a number of other common thrushes. The hermit has
a wide range, summering up into mid-Canada and wintering in
the southern United States and Mexico. Veery, Swainson&rsquo;s, and
gray-cheeked thrushes are also widespread. The wood thrush is
the largest and probably the most citified, at least in terms of living
in woody areas near cities. It is also the only one with a
heavily spotted breast.</p>
<p>The nest is similar to a robin&rsquo;s, but without so much mud, and
is usually twenty-five feet or less from the ground in a tree or
shrub.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<div><img class="tn" src="images/img026b.png" alt="" width="98" height="117" /></div>
<h2 class="bird" id="c49">YELLOWTHROAT
<br /><span class="small">(Geothlypis trichas)</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="photo49">
<img src="images/img026c.jpg" alt="" width="556" height="505" />
</div>
<p>This is a gay little warbler that is abundant, at least in summer,
across the United States and most of Canada wherever there
are moist shrubby areas. It&rsquo;s a permanent resident in southernmost
United States and northern Mexico&mdash;and north up the
Pacific coast to San Francisco. The yellowthroat lives in shrubs in
moist areas, showing its distinctive markings to passersby. The
female doesn&rsquo;t have a black mask, but otherwise looks much like
the male.</p>
<p>These warblers nest on or near the ground in moist areas and
eat mainly insects, including plant lice; don&rsquo;t look for them in the
tops of tall trees. Adults are about 5 inches long. There are, of
course, a lot of warblers over the continent, but the yellowthroat
is widely distributed and widely admired. Keep your wet areas if
you want to keep yellowthroats around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<div><img class="tn" src="images/img027.png" alt="" width="107" height="114" /></div>
<h2 class="bird" id="c50">YELLOW WARBLER
<br /><span class="small">(Dendroica petechia)</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="photo50">
<img src="images/img027a.jpg" alt="" width="423" height="627" />
</div>
<p>Although similar to the goldfinch, this warbler lacks the black
wings and tail. Its cheerful, bright call can be heard by urban
dwellers from willows, small trees, and shrubs growing on wet
grounds and in residential areas that contain an open growth of
small ornamental trees.</p>
<p>A tropic winterer, he breeds from the tree limit in Canada to
the southern states. When plagued by cowbirds laying eggs in its
nest, this warbler builds a second nest on top of the first, completely
covering the cowbird&rsquo;s eggs, and any of its own in the
bottom layer.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
